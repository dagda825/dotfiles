* Beginner Keybindings
** What do the Keys mean again?
C - press (and hold) the Control button
M - press (and hold) the ALT     button
S - press (and hold) the SHIFT   button

** Buffer control

C-x C-f finds (opens) a file and opens it into a new buffer
C-x b   switches to a buffer
C-x C-b opens a buffer list and let's you choose one
C-x k   closes (kills) the current buffer. if the buffer contains
        unsaved changes, emacs prompts you to save them
C-x s   saves the contents of the buffer

** Window Control

C-x 0   This deletes the current window. if you only have one
        window open, it will not close it.
C-x 1   This deletes all other open windows except the one with
        the cursor on it.
C-x O   Note: that's the OH letter, not Zero. Cycles through
        the windows.
C-x 2   split window below the current one
C-x 3   split window to the right
C-x ^   Increase the height of the current window
C-x {   decrease the width of the current window
C-x }   increase the width of the current window
*** If you have winmove installed:
Note: RA,LA, UA and DA are the arrow keys. Left Right Up Down
S- RA   go to the window to right
S- LA   go to the window to the left
S- UA   go to the window above
S- DA   go to the window below

** dired is indespensible
C-x d   opens dired
C-x C-f finds (find file on a directory)
      n go down one line on the dired list
      p go up   one line on the dired list
      
    RET open the file or directory
      g refresh the dired buffer list
      o open the file or directory under the cursor
        into a new window
    C-o opens the file under the cursor in the current
        window without switching to it.
*** file operations
      noob note: many of these opertions also work on
                 the buffer list. Probably a LOT more
		 lists. Maybe ALL lists.

      d flags the file or directory for deletion. BEWARE
      u unflags the file or directory for deletion.
      U unflags all marked files or directories for deletion
      x deletes all files or directories flagged for
        deletion
      C copies the file or directory
      R renames the file or directory
      m marks the file or directory
      U unmarks the file or directory
      + creates a new directory
